Polynucleotides are highly purified re-absorbable substances of fish origin. Besides their moisturising properties, they play a trophic action on fibroblasts improving both elasticity and tonicity of the tissues. Hyaluronic acid is also one of the major constituents of the extracellular dermal matrix giving tissues mechanical and elastic properties and also improving turgidity and hydration. Endogenous hyaluronic acid decreases with age and this lower concentration contributes to altering tissue structures thereby accelerating their ageing process. The two substances mixed together trigger a synergic action consisting in a strong moisturizing effect, induced by both components (hyaluronic acid in particular), combined with the trophic action of the polynucleotides thus recovering and/or improving trophism and tonicity of the skin."
