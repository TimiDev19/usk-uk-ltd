When women reach a certain age, tissues tend to shrink, especially around the labia majora. This can damage the natural protection of the vulva and lead to localised pain. Hyaluronic acid recreates volume around the labia majora to protect the vulva. Desirial Plus is intended for injection just under the labia majora dermis."

Polynucleotides are highly purified re-absorbable substances of fish origin. Besides their moisturising properties, they play a trophic action on fibroblasts improving both elasticity and tonicity of the tissues. Hyaluronic acid is also one of the major constituents of the extracellular dermal matrix giving tissues mechanical and elastic properties and also improving turgidity and hydration. Endogenous hyaluronic acid decreases with age and this lower concentration contributes to altering tissue structures thereby accelerating their ageing process. The two substances mixed together trigger a synergic action consisting in a strong moisturizing effect, induced by both components (hyaluronic acid in particular), combined with the trophic action of the polynucleotides thus recovering and/or improving trophism and tonicity of the skin."

            description: "Ageing manifests as a result of the interplay of changes in the facial skeleton, ligaments, muscles, adipose tissue, and skin. The characteristic signs of ageing in facial skin are, in part, associated with age-related alterations in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of the face. The movement of fat within compartments, due to gravity, can result in an inferomedial displacement of the overlying skin envelope. This repositioning or shift of fat often leads to increased hollows in the cheeks and to a flattening of facial angles. Consequently, there is a loss of fat volume in the middle and lateral cheek compartments."

This makes Hyaluronic Acid Anti-Ageing Solution an ideal moisture base, facilitating the delivery of other agents to the skin. An interesting solution for mesotherapy treatments recommended for treating wrinkled, tired, sundamaged and dried-out skin. In combination with vitamins, hyaluronic acid not only helps to prevent signs of ageing, but also works to treat them."
